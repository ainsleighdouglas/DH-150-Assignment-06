## Brief Project Summary
#### Purpose: 
The purpose of creating low fidelity prototypes is to test the flow of a website and how intuitive the interactions are. Using low fidelity prototypes for the designer is to create a flow that does not have any distracting features, that can be altered easily and gives the look and feel of a website.

This prototype was designed keeping in mind middle aged women and what would assist in their interaction with the website. I kept in mind average technology experience/knowledge, accessibility of visuals and low cognitive stress. During the user's experience they should have the ability to navigate the site to any extent they want, from searching a specific genre to being directed to a specific show.

#### Task 1: 
Personalize home screen in settings and return to home
- This is a new feature I designed keeping in mind customizability and preference when using a streaming platform. The user should be able to manipulate and    customize their home screen to their preferences. Ex// the user wants “suggested shows” to be at the top of the home page because that is what they use the most. Although setting this feature up may be out of some users comfort zone, in the long run it reduces cognitive stress.

#### Task 2:
Access the horror genre and select a show 
- Since I moved around some of the features on the landing page that may be inconsistent with other platforms I wanted to make sure that simple tasks were still accessible.

#### Task 3:
Expand the recently watched menu, switch to favorites in the toolbar and “share a show”
- I wanted to reduce the clutter on the home screen so I made a feature that expands on categories of the user's choosing. Although I used fairly common icons I wanted to make sure that this flow was still intuitive to the user. Additionally I wanted to show that you can navigate to almost every feature from any screen, not just the home page.

#### Task 4: 
Access “your feed” through the live icon in the toolbar and start watching a show
- “Your feed” is a new way of viewing your suggested and recently watched categories in a way that allows you to preview the first 15 seconds of each show in a social media type setting. This way if you are undecided on what you like to watch this feature initiates and feeds you the show. In this case you are more likely to decide on something faster because it is right in front of you. Since this is a completely new feature and icon I created for my streaming platform and I wanted to see if the user could find and access it using the powers of deduction. 

Additionally I tested a prototype for desktop as well as mobile to take into consideration that some features are more intuitive in one platform versus the other. 

## Prototype Testing

#### Initial paper prototypes:

#### User testing video:

#### Tasks and corresponding colors:

1. Personalize home screen in settings and return to home (green)
2. Access the horror genre and select a show (red)
3. Expand the recently watched menu, switch to favorites in the toolbar and “share a show” (Purple)
4. Access “your feed” through the live icon in the toolbar and start watching a show

#### Features description:
The user always begins at the login page which will always land them on the home page. There will always be two ways to navigate from the home page: using the toolbar (which includes the search feature) and using the drop down menu from the icon with the three horizontal bars. On desktop all of these features are located at the top and on mobile the drop down menu can be accessed from the top and the toolbar can be found at the bottom. For both versions the icon remains highlighted to show which page you are on. The toolbar leads you to five features: home page, favorites, your feed, search and downloads. Each page categorizes shows best fitting their description (Ex: Favorites would lead you to your liked or saved shows). The drop down menu is another way of categorizing shows you can access (genres, recently watched, etc.). The drop down menu also includes more technical features such as settings, profile and and logging out. Other points of interaction is the “X” to close out pages that don’t show the toolbar.
